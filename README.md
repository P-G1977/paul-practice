# My very first webpage

Welcome! [Code institute] (https://codeinstitute.net)

This was a project called 'first project in a cloud IDE' for my Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development.
In this project we cloned a Codeinstitute template and created three html documents with images and links and a
CSS stylesheet to style the html. The end result is two rows of three images that link to the Wikipedia page for that
image.

### Stream One:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* Cloud9
* Git
* GitHub

### Stream Two:
* Python
* Flask
* MongoDB
* MySQL
* Git
* GitHub

### Stream Three:
* Python
* Django
* Herohu
* Git
* GitHub
* MySQL

This was my first practice using GitPod IDE and using git commands to push my changes to the repository.
